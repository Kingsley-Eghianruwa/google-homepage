# google-homepage
the odin project-google page project.

This page was built as a project required by The Odin Project.

It was built by Kingsley Eghianruwa, using HTML and CSS.
The page has no javascript, and the links go nowhere.

It was carried out to test out my html and css proficiency.

For the css, tailwind css was used.
This allowed me quickly pick up using css. i am now a fan of utility class css and will explore this area more.
